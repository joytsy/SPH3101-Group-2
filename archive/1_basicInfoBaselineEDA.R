# Summary statistics of treatment duration
## Brief Summary: Generally treatment duration hover around 180+ days, with min 116 days and max 364 days.
## According to IQR outlier calculation, there are 187 observations that are considered outliers.
## From histogram, around 10 observations with treatment duration of < 150 or > 200 days.

# Distribution of Treatment Status
## Brief Summary
## Univariate Analysis: Majority (58.2%) have completed their treatment, followed by being cured (37.6%). Remaining cases have died, lost to F/U or classified under other reasons.
## Contingency Table: Relatively balanced for completed, cured and loss to f/u cases, but quite skewed for the rest.

## Brief Summary
## Univariate Analysis: 46.1% come from Kandal, followed by 22.2% from Tboung Khmum, 18.7% from Kampong Cham and 12.9% from Phnom Penh.
## Contingency Table: Stigma levels relatively balanced in Kandal and Phnom Penh. Most individuals experience high stigma in Kampong Cham, while the opposite for Tboung Khmum.

## Brief Summary
## Univariate Analysis: Top 3 Operational Districts with this cohort of TB diagnosed individuals are Sa Ang Health OD (28.1%), Ou Raing Euv Health OD (19.7%) and Stung Trang Health OD (10.8%).
## Contingency Table: Most skewed stigma levels in Kang Meas Health OD, Stung Trang Health OD and Lvea Em Health OD. Most balanced relative to the rest: Leuk Dek Health OD, Sen Sok Health OD and Po Sen Chey Health OD.

# Distribution of Types of TB
## Brief Summary: Only 3 types of TB detected in this cohort, with 56.4% with TB Bac-, 38.5% with TB Bac+ and 5.1% with RR TB.
## Contingency Table: Still relatively balanced for Bac+ and Bac-, slightly skewed for RR-TB cases.

# Group by case_status and get boxplot of stigma scores by different case_status
## Brief Summary: From boxplot, we observe that lost to f/u group has a higher median stigma score than the other groups. 
## While cured and completed groups seems to have similar median stigma scores. 
## Died group has the 2nd lowest median stigma score, and other group has the lowest median stigma score.
## Tried removing outlier observation with score 36, results remain the same except mean=15.0 (down from 15.1).
## Removing both scores 0 and 36 -> results same except mean=15.2 (up from 15.1).

## RR TB cases have a lower IQR score range as compared to the other 2 types.
## Bac- Type has the extreme scores 0 and 36.
